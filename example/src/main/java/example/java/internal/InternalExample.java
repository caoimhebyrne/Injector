/**
 * This is where it gets spicy. ðŸ”¥
 *
 * This is a simple Proof Of Concept, you're gonna need
 * a bit more engineering to make something useful out of this,
 * aka allow your classes to be called from the bootclassloader.
 *
 * Doing this in Java is necessary because the Kotlin compiler
 * will try sticking his <code>Intrinsics</code> calls everywhere,
 * and it gets quite messy really quick.
